# Push Swap

This project asks you to sort data in a stack, using a limited set
of instructions, and with as few operations as possible.


## Rules

- sa (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of the stack a.
    Does nothing if there is only one or none.
- sb (swap b ) : Swap the first 2 elements at the top of the stack b.
    Does nothing if there is only one or none.
- ss : sa and sb at the same time.
- pa (push a): Takes the first element on top of b and puts it on a.
    Does nothing if b is empty.
- pb (push b): Takes the first element on top of a and puts it on b.
    Does nothing if a is empty.
- ra (rotate a): Shifts all the elements of the stack a up by one position.
    The first element becomes the last.
- rb (rotate b) : Shifts all the elements of the stack b one position upwards.
    The first element becomes the last one.
- rr : ra and rb at the same time.
- rra (reverse rotate a): Shifts all the elements of the stack a down one position. The last element becomes the first.
- rrb (reverse rotate b): Shifts all the elements of the b-stack downwards by one position. the b stack. The last element becomes the first.
- rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.
